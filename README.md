# CRUD with PHP & MySQL

### This is a small example of an application where you manage a to-do list. Different tasks are created, listed, edited, and deleted using forms and tables as required.

The application was created following the tutorial [PHP Mysql CRUD - Fazt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn2v9lPakHQ).
